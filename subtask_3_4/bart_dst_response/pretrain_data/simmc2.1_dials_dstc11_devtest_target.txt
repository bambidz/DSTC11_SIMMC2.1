<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the grey pair on the left? <end>

<cls> <sep2> That dress has a high rating at 4.3. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry. I don't have any floral dresses right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry. I don't have any blouses like that from New Fashion. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Of course! The brown coat is shown in size XL and the black one in size L. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I have these three pair on the bottom, what do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, No results came back from that search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's a size L,  from Cats Are Great. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, we don't. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll make sure those are in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't see any. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like the grey pair in the second cubby or the dark blue pair next to it? They are both jeans. <end>

The tank is a medium, while the long-sleeved top is a small. Last but not least, these shirts are both priced at $39.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly! That grey tank will be in your cart momentarily. <end>

<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the purple one hanging up against the wall, the center one on the bottom row, the violet one on the table, just to the left of the pink shirt, and the red one that's on the same row, the second one from the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm confirming that order and adding them to your cart. <end>

<cls> <sep2> On the closer round rack, I have the black one at the front left, the black and white one at the front right, and the red and yellow one in the cabinet closest to the door. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't believe I do.  Can I help you with anything else? <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure I'll add that black coat to your cart? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this green sweater, this red and black one, or this pink one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Have a look at the folded one on the right on the table or the one up top in the third cubby from the end. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are pink, the folded one is from Coats & More and the other is from Uptown Gallery. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I'll add those both to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one you're getting is the best option I see. <end>

<cls> <sep2> There's two options here, a brown one and a purple one hanging in the front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find any like that. <end>

<cls> <sep2> No problem, I've placed both in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both 184.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which coat do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It has a 4.1 rating and it's from Downtown Stylists. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course. I'll add that now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a white and grey blouse on the shelf to the left, as well as a white, black, and red blouse and a black and white, both hanging on the rack to the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which jeans do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both pairs of jeans are XS. The dark blue jeans are from Modern Arts and the blue and black are from Ocean Wears. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The blue and black jeans are XS display trousers from Ocean Wears which cost 244.99. They have a rating of 4.6 and a denim pattern. They are available in XXL and XS. The dark blue jeans are also XS display trousers but are from Modern Arts. They cost 184.99. They have a 4.7 rating and a denim pattern. They come in XL, S, XS, XXL, and M. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think the following three jackets are in your style: the light grey one on the floor hanger by the entrance, the black one near it, and another black one on the floor hanger in the middle of the room. Do you like any of them? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can suggest the light grey jacket on that rack,  the brown one  in the first cupboard from the right, in the second compartment from the right, and, of course, the black jacket on the rack by the entrance itself. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black jacket from Yogi Fit costs 174.99. The light grey one, from 212Local, has a lower price, 44.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure! I am adding it as we speak. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course! You will see them in your cart in a second. <end>
<cls> <sep2> May I offer you the black sweater on the left  and another black one on the left side  of the floor rack closer to us? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course! Both pairs are from Modern Arts  and shown in size XS. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have two jackets that fit these requirements, the light grey one on the left of the wall rack and the brown one on the same rack but  on the right in the bottom row. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I have no plain-color  jackets  in your preferred price range that have favorable reviews. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I found a black dress that fits that description on the left wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't see anything like that. Would you like to continue shopping? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey and white StyleNow Feed blouse is rated at 2.9 with a leafy pattern and long sleeves. It is priced at 54.99 and shown in S, but available in XS, S, M, XL. The black Modern Arts blouse  is rated 4.9 with long sleeves and priced at 54.99. It is shown in XXL, but available in M, L, XL, and XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add those two blouses to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That blouse is shown in size S <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the purple shirt on the wall in back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Aside from those two options, I can recommend the red, white and violet blouse on the left wall <end>
<cls> <sep2> I suggest looking at the light grey coat on the left wall, the brown coat underneath on the same wall, or the brown coat on the circular rack to the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white and grey one is available in XS, S, M, XL and the black one is in M, L, XL, XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Would you consider the long-sleeve black one hanging to the left, the black one on the shelves next to the pink sweater, or the long-sleeve grey and white blouse one shelf to the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The jeans on the very end are made by Modern Arts. The lighter pair is made by Yogi Fit. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay! I will put both of those jeans in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sadly, there do not seem to be any options by that brand. What else can I do for you today? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I do not have any more suggestions as far as blouses are concerned. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Can I get your opinion on that solid brown jacket hanging above the pair of light-wash jeans? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The darker pair is an extra small. It is also in stock in small, medium, extra large, and extra extra large. The lighter pair is a medium and is also in stock in extra small, large, extra large, and extra extra large. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think you'll find the three black dresses in the two inner shelves all surpass your expectations. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay! I'll add those black dresses to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this brown jacket in the shelf display, second from the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have this grey pair at the bottom of the shelf display. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure I can add both blouses. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which blouses are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The green and white blouse is available in XS, S, and XL and is rated 2.9. The grey and white blouse is available in XXL, L, and S and is rated 2.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have this black dress on the second shelf from the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this grey and brown shirt on the table display and the violet shirt on the racks next to the table? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those two pairs of jeans to the right on the shelves are a match for your criteria! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Would you mind identifying more precisely which pair of jeans have caught your eye? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those jeans are offered in extra small, small, medium, extra large, and extra extra large. They have been awarded an impressive rating of 4.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a grey shirt folded up on the table to the right in between a red sweater and a grey and white striped shirt. See if that one works for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That brand also makes the pair to the right of them. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes. There are no other Modern Arts jeans, sorry. <end>
<cls> <sep2> This first brown one on the left might interest you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's this light grey coat at the top left of the wall hanger display, the brown coat on the bottom right of the wall hanger display, and the brown coat on the circular hanger display. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which brown coat are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's size XL and is from Downtown Stylists/ <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry I can't find anything that matches. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The light grey coat on the top left of the the wall display is the best match. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing I'll add it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like the brown jacket on the shelf second from the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I found no matches for that search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> On the table, we have a red one in back and a pink one in front, take a look. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will put those in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I have no matches for that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The third has a 4.4 rating and the fifth a 3.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have these in the third cubicle down, check them out. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That has a 4.7 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have these two, the first dress on the right side of the floor rack and the one in the second to last cubicle. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about the green ones shown on the far left compartment? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but nothing else came up. Can I keep looking for something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's what I found. There's a black and white blouse hanging up on the front of the rack on the right, a white, red, and violet one in the second upper cubicle on the left, and a white and black one that's on the right side of the rack on the right. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Which ones are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those jeans are rated by customers as 4.7 and cost 184.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm confirming your purchase of both items. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about the black one in the second row of compartments, second from the left? In the next cubicle over you'll also see a black and white one that's available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, I'm doing that now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about the one in the second compartment in the second row, just to the left of the blouse you just purchased. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but I couldn't find anything. Would you like me to look for something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, unfortunately, I couldn't find a match for a well reviewed jacket by Downtown Stylists in grey and white. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've found something that matches your criteria. You'll see it on the far left side of the upper row of compartments. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I did find a pink sweater, and you'll see it hanging up in the compartment just to the right of the brown sweater. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Both are dark blue and are made by Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> In the third cabinet, I have the brown jacket at the far left. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Here's the grey and white jacket in the middle shelf. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That grey and white jacket and the blue one close to it are the best matches. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure I'll add the jacket. <end>
<cls> <sep2> what about the two black blouses in the middle shelf? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are two black coats at the right of the shelf display. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can't find any coat like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've got the brown one at the bottom right, the gray one at the top middle, and the gray-brown one two to the right of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've got the gray one, the gray-brown one in the same row, and the dark pink one in the bottom middle. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, none of them are.  May I help you find something else? <end>

<cls> <sep2> No they are not.  Anything else I could help you find? <end>

<cls> <sep2> There is a black coat on the far right, as well as another option directly to the left of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry I don't have anything else to show you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There are some blue and black jeans on the far right, a dark blue pair in the third compartment, and some dark blue ones in the first compartment. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, those are the only ones with those same features. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No blouses fit that description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the two lighter colored ones on the left wall and one on the back of the carousel, take a look. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one on the wall sells for $179.99 with a 3.8 rating and the other one lists for $59.99 with a 4.1 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the last one in the second cubicle and the blue one on the carousel. <end>

<cls> <sep2> The one on the carousel is $59.99 with a 4.1 rating and the one on the wall is $179.99 with a 3.8 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I have a few.  First, at the bottom right you can see a pink sweater folded on the table.  Moving the the shelving units, you can see a black sweater hanging up under the red shoe boxes, and further down is a light pink sweater, also under some red shoe boxes. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything matching those parameters. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, the black sweater hanging in the shelving unit is actually a knit pattern. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, the black sweater is rated 3.1, while the pink sweater is rated 3.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> 3.1 for the black sweater, 3.8 for the pink. <end>

<cls> <sep2> They're both a size XL.  The black sweater is from Downtown Consignment, and the green one is from River Chateau. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I suggest you take a look at that black and white spotted shirt on the left and the black blouse hanging behind the grey and white jacket. <end>

<cls> <sep2> The short-sleeved blouse only costs $4.99 and is rated a 2.6. The long-sleeved one is rated a 3.7 and costs $74.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I cannot find any options for your consideration. Would you like help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The blue jacket is more budget-friendly. It costs $39.99, while the grey and white jacket costs $109.99. However, the grey and white jacket is offered in a broader size range. I can get it for you in the following sizes: extra small, small, medium, large, and extra extra large. The blue jacket currently comes in small, medium, extra large, and extra extra large. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Got it! I am adding these items to your cart now. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I'm afraid those are the only jeans with good ratings at the moment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, check out this pink sweater above the blue jeans. That is shown in size S. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I have the pink one in the top cubby. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This one is made by Yogi Fit. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the pink sweater. It is a small. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I found a violet one folded on the front corner of the table that you might like. <end>

<cls> <sep2> How do you like the brown jacket hanging up on the bottom left, or the black jacket hanging up on the upper right?  Both are in the expensive price range. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I have two good wood-colored shelves: one on the left, by the end of the divider, and one further down the room, about the middle of that divider. Do you like them? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I am so sorry, I have no shelves with high ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Absolutely! You have these shelves in your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure. That table is in your cart too. <end>
<cls> <sep2> This is the only coffee table I have from Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have these two wooden shelves available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but I don't have any wooden shelves with a good rating that are inexpensive. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which chair are you interested in? <end>

<cls> <sep2> The one in back goes for $199 and has a rating of 3.8. The other costs $499 and has a rating of 3.6. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any Modern Arts chairs available that are cheap. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You may be interested in the brown chair next to the kitchen island. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Perfect! I'll add the chair to your shopping cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you feel about the black and white rug up front or the red one to the rear left? They're both expensive. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll add that to your cart as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's this wooden one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing else like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's from Art Den, and it's made of pine. <end>

<cls> <sep2> OK, I will add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about the wooden coffee table in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, that is the only item available. I couldn't find anything else that matched your search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what about the wooden shelves next to the dresser or the other wooden shelves? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white area rug costs $449 and is from Home Store while the red area rug costs $199 and is from Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the ones on the right next to the wall, or the ones to the left of the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They're both made of wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can't find anything that meets that description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can't find anything similar to that. Is there anything else I can do for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this chair up front? It's leather and comes from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'll add it for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I couldn't get that for you. Is there anything else I could get for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I couldn't find a chair from that brand, or at an affordable price at a 4.2 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like the brown one to the right of the kitchen island? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That brown chair is the best fit for your decor. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! The chair and the shelf will be added to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which item would you like the brand for? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What to you think of the rounded brown chair to the left of the white chair on the white rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, we don't have any other brown chairs from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chair you just looked at has a good rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly.  I'll add it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything like that. Can I help with anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the three tier shelf on the left of the partition, or the one along the partition on the right hand side? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, sorry, I don't. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll put them in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, well how about the wooden coffee table in the back on the red patterned rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly.  I'll add that to your cart right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which chair would you like to know about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chair has a customer rating of 4.2. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I found two wooden shelves with good ratings. The brown on against the wall in the back, and the darker brown one to the left of the black set against the wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those two are the closest match. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find anything with that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I'll add two of those shelves to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes of course.  What do you think of that wooden one on the red rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That is the only one in the expensive price range. <end>
<cls> <sep2> On the diamond patterned rug, we have the rounded-profile brown chair in leather by Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The wooden one I showed you before would be a good fit, I believe. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's a red one and a white one that are both available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those wooden shelves are the only ones available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Absolutely, I'll add that now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's nothing available at this time. Can I help with something else today? <end>
<cls> <sep2> You may like the brown one to the right of the island. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That is the only one of that style that I have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item would you like the reviews of? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, that has a 4.2 customer rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a red one in  the back and a white one up front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will put those two in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, which one did you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's from Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The short tan shelf to the right against the wall might be a good fit! Or perhaps I could interest you in the dark brown three-tiered shelf in front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You sure can! I'll get right to it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Would you mind clarifying which rug you're asking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Oh! Home Store is the brand that makes this rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at this brown one on the right. What do you think of it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Could you clarify what you're referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That costs $299. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, that is the only one available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've got two wooden shelves from this brand. The first one is to the left of the room divider in front of us. The second one is next to the middle of that room divider. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one further away from us is more expensive--it goes for $499. The one closer to us costs $199. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like the wooden coffee table by the green couch in front of us and a little to the left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly! It will show in your cart in a second. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the red rug in the far back left, or the white one here up in the front? <end>
<cls> <sep2> These are the only ones we have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, adding it now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I've added a second white rug to your bag. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this red rug or this white one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red has a 3.6 rating, while the white has a 3.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which items are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are made from natural fibers. The white costs $449 and the red $199. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think of the coffee table at the back left beside the blue sofa? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, sorry that's the only one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything that fits that search. <end>

<cls> <sep2> The one on the right costs $499, and the one on the left costs $199. They're both made by Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything similar. Can I help you find anything else? <end>

<cls> <sep2> These two rugs, the red and the white, are the only one I currently have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is made of natural fibers and has a 3.6 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Absolutely, I'll add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the wooden shelves near the divide and the other wooden shelves against the divide? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I do not have anything else that matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, that is the only option to fit your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You got it. I'll add it to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have one brown chair next to the island. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Of course, I'll do so right away! <end>

<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find a high end table by Modern Arts. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I don't have any chairs like that at the moment, you may want to check back when next season's items come in. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Well, wood is always a good choice to coordinate with.  I have the short wooden ones at the left side of the half wall, as well as the light-tone wood cabinet to the right with the drawer and doors. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Excellent choices!  I'll update your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Are you interested in the red rug in the back left and this white rug here? These will cover a lot of surface. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug is the only item by this brand. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The two shelving units are both made of wood, and they differ on customer rating. The left shelving unit is given a 3.2 star rating, while the right shelving unit has a 4.4 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've taken into account your request for this brown chair. I'll add that to your cart right away. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Two options you might consider are the three tier set in front of the dividing wall and the chest style along that wall to the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are made from wood. The set I've added to your cart has a 4.4 rating and the others have a 3.2 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any other similar wooden shelves from Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are two sets that match your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I only have the two options I showed you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, the two options I showed you are all I have available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add those to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I found two possible shelves, one in front of the front partition, and the other directly to the left of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I only have those two shelves available at the moment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything. Can I point anything else to you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add those now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the wooden coffee table at the far end of the room, in front of the blue sofa? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a few options for shelves; how do you like the wooden shelves on the left end of the near wall?  If you want something with closing doors, I can also offer the wooden shelving unit on the right end of that wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, the near rug is priced at $449, and the far rug at $199. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The near rug is made by Home Store, and the far rug is made by Art Den.  Both are made from natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing matches your description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There are two brown shelves that you might like. On opposite ends of the divide. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both of those items are from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You got it. They will be added. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I found two you might like. There's a wooden cabinet against the wall on the right, and some open wooden shelves on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which chair are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That has a 4.2 rating and costs $299. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm afraid those two shelves are the only thing that fit your description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Have you considered these brown ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are some you might like! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I couldn't find anything like that. Is there anything else you'd be interested in seeing? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, no problem. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think of the wooden one against the wall or the other wooden one to its left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about that wooden one towards the very back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, we do not have low-priced ones at the moment matching your preferences. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think about the red one in the back or the white one in the front here? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a red one in the back and a white one in the front. Do you like either of them? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, this is the only red one we have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one has a 3.6 rating and the red a 3.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the wooden one in the back left set? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but there aren't any other wooden Art Den coffee tables. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's wooden. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What are your thoughts on the white rug at the front by us? It's from Home Store. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The wooden colored shelf to the back against the wall or the darker brown to the left of that might work. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I didn't find anything else. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! Adding them to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Tell me, what is your opinion of the coffee table in the back? It matches all of your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Only the wooden shelves you pointed out match your description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you talking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It has a rating of 3.2 and is from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the wooden table on the back left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's the only coffee table like it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any other coffee tables here. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That coffee table is the only one like it I have here. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, how do you like the brown chair on the white geometric rug to your right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug is made by Home Store, has a customer rating of 3.6, and is available for $449.  The red rug is made by Art Den, has a customer rating of 3.8, and is available for $199.  Both are made from natural fibers. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure, that first brown chair that we looked at is made of leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the rounded brown chair at the edge of the white rug? <end>

<cls> <sep2> Just that one brown chair we're talking about. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly.  I'll take care of your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I found two rugs for you. Take a look at the white rug and the red rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't understand which rug you're referring to. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That rug is made with natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't see any shelves like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You might consider the black and white one in the front under the islands. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find a rug like you want with a good rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You might like the brown chair on the black and white rug. The one by the island facing away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I'll get those into your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> For rugs, I would recommend the red one to the left in the back, and the white rug in the front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Well, what do you think of the brown shelves to the left on the white rug, or the lighter brown one to the right against the divider? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one to the left costs $199 but has a 3.2 rating. The one to the right costs $499 but has a 4.4. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Well, how about the brown chair to the very right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The wooden cabinet to the right and the shorter wooden shelves to the left are well rated. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both made of wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any other shelves that are well rated. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay. I've put that in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Tell me what you think about the wooden shelves in the front set. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Those are the only options, sorry. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but those are still the only tables I have to offer you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the wooden one to the right, or the one on the left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Would you clarify which items you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are made of wood and are from Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are wooden and retail for $649. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That grey one in the back at the far edge of the white rug looks like it was made for you! <end>
<cls> <sep2> That is the only grey sofa at this time, unfortunately. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Woops, I can't figure out which table you like. Do you mind describing it to me? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That table has a nearly unbeatable average customer rating of 4.9. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure. What do you think of the grey sofa on the back right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I will add that grey sofa to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do have a a rug like that. How about the grey rug on the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure! I will add that to your cart. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I will certainly do that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The nearest one is from StyleNow Feed with a 4.9 rating and the farther one is from North Lodge with a 3.7 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like this grey one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add those two to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find anything like that. Is there anything else I could do for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add this item to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I do not. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the same white option to show you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will do that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like the grey one in the very back left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like either of the two brown ones in front of the couches? Both are coffee tables. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This sofa is rated 3.1 and is made out of leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've got two options that meet those requirements! Tell me what you think of the brown wooden one back there in front of the grey sofa on the white rug and the other brown table in front to the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Woops, it isn't clear to me which items you are talking about. Please describe them in more detail. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those tables both boast an average customer rating of 3.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, there are no white tables made by Art Den with higher ratings for that price. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the wooden coffee table on the far right set, as well as the wooden one on the far left set. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you referring to? <end>

<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have anything affordable. What else can I get you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one on the left is made by Art Den and is rated 3.8. The one on the right is also by Art Den and rated 3.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have one on the left and another on the far right. Do either strike your fancy? <end>

<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is a leather armchair. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, how do you like the wooden coffee table on the white rug on the right?  If you want something with more surface area, the coffee table on the blue rug to your left would also be a good choice. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I've added that one to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything matching that description in stock.  Is there anything else I can help you find? <end>

<cls> <sep2> It's made of wood with a 3.8 rating. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I can suggest the grey and white jacket and the red and white jacket that are hanging at the top. <end>

<cls> <sep2> These two jackets are the best fit. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red one is available in XS and L and the grey one is available in XS-L <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the grey and white jacket or the red and white one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those are the only jackets I have right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything else at this time. Can I help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The former has a 3.3 rating and comes in XS and L. The latter has a 4.9 and is available in S, XS, M, L, and XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, nothing matches that description. What else can I do for you? <end>

<cls> <sep2> I've got the gray and white patterned one at the top left, and on the bottom rack I have the other gray and white one, and the sleeveless black one at the left end. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black one is made by Downtown Consignment. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I would like to show you three blouses. Going from right to left, look at the maroon, white, and blue one, the red, white, and yellow one, and the black one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, that blouse is the only one in these colors. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You may like three pairs. Going from right to left, consider the three grey pairs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I am sorry, could you explain which items you are interested in? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Got it, thanks! Each pair costs 189.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a red, white, and yellow blouse on the right closet which you might find of interest. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Would the blue one on the left side of the back turnstile work? Or there are also two black jackets on the front side of the other rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black coat on the right side of the front rack is a match, as are the grey one and black one on the other rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There don't appear to be any more matches. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The hat on the shelf meets those conditions. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but no. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've got the blue jacket closest to the hat table on the rack in the front, and another blue jacket nearest the gray ottoman on the rack in the back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> For which jacket? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That jacket is a S. <end>

<cls> <sep2> None at this time, no. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have those and the black shoes next to them. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The left ones are XS and from HairDo. The right are S and from Uptown Studio. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem. I've put those in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a blue hoodie and a green hoodie. What do you think of those? <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a pink and white blouse, a black blouse, and a maroon, white, and blue blouse that match your closet. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a black blouse and a white, black, and red blouse on your left closet. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black blouse has a rating of 3.7 and is from StyleNow Feed. The white, black, and red blouse has a rating of 4.5 and is from North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, it will be added to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have anything that matches that. Can I help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, take a look at this pink and white blouse on the bottom right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, I have a white, black, and red blouse on the back right, a maroon, white, and blue blouse on the very left, and a black one behind that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I'll do that right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll update your cart to reflect that! <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can help you find that. I have the white and red one hanging in the cubby on the far right, the pink and white one on the front rack, and the black one on the same rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have that one in the top cubby, the maroon and blue one in the front left cubby, and the black one in the cubby behind it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I will add it now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one on the rack is rated 2.8 and is available in small, medium, and large. The one in the cubby is rated 3.4 and is available only in small. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the brown jacket on the center rack. It is a plain jacket. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think of this green hoodie on the bottom right, or the blue one on the very left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm afraid there isn't anything else like that. Can I help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, right away! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That hoodies is shown in size S and costs $129.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can help with that. I have the blue one in the left cubby and the green one on the right rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I'll put these hoodies in your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one on the rack is by Downtown Consignment and the one in the cubby is by Global Voyager. Both are small. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are rated 4.7 and they cost $184.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The wooden table on the green patterned rug to the left of the partition would work.  How about it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the white chair next to the table I just showed you, the brown chair next to the table in the partitioned off area, and the chair on wheels on the red patterned rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly!  Adding it now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That table I showed you earlier is made of wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I recommend two white sofa chairs, the one in front of us and the one at the far end of the next display, on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have some wooden shelves in the last display in this room on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I cannot find anything else; sorry about that.  If you have any other requests, I will be happy to help. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure! I am putting the sofa and the chair into your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but this selection does not seem to have an affordable area rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'd be happy to help you find some expensive, wooden shelves. Take a look at the wooden shelves along the divider in the back of the store. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's great. I'll add these wooden shelves to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'm putting one white sofa chair in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the white rug to the left and in the back, or the red rug in the middle of the display? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I didn't find anything, sorry. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which couch? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It has a 2.9. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I have a white rug on the left and a red one in the center. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything that fits those requirements. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The only ones available are the two I showed you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I'll put those in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey one in back on the left is the brand you're looking for. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which item? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one is $399 and has a 4.9 rating, while the black one is $549 and has a 3.7 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The ones towards the back, up against the partition wall might be what you need. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the brown chair in the back, the white chair behind the table, or the brown desk chair? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this red area rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Check out this brown chair from the back, this white chair behind the table, and this brown desk chair. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I cannot find a chair that is affordable and has a good rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Tell me what you think about the wooden table? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add it to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but I could not find anything that matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add two of the wooden tables to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Tell me your thoughts on those two backless beige pieces! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Turn your attention if you will to that lovely brown table on the blue floral rug in the back right corner! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll get those in your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great choices! I'm adding those to your cart as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can't find anything that matches your criteria. What else may I help you with? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything else that matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add it to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You got it, I'll add it to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the white couch chair in the background and the one in the forefront? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything matching that description. What else can I help you with? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add those items to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the wooden ones in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white one or the red one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any other options. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok I will add them. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the grey sofa by Modern Arts in the back right set. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find anything matching that description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you talking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They're both $449 and by Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The wooden table by the bookshelves in back may work for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, which item are you interested in? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The rating on that table is 3.2 and it is listed at $399. <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is there now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Based on those criteria, I have the brown chair in the partitioned area, the white chair next to the table on the green rug in the back, and the brown wheeled chair on the red rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any chairs like that, unfortunately.  Could I help you find something else instead? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I don't happen to have any Modern Arts chairs in stock.  Is there anything else you'd like to see? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Nice choice.  I'll add that chair to your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Does either the beige ottoman by the grey couch up front or the shorter beige ottoman on the second blue rug appeal to your flair for home decor? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I apologize, but it would seem those are the only uscale ottomans I can offer you at this time. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white end table has a near-perfect customer rating of 4.9 and is produced by StyleNow Feed. The black table, on the other hand, is rated at 3.7 and is made by North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'd be happy to. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the gray one in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red one is $199 and made from natural fibers, while the white one is $249 and made from natural fibers as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about these these two white ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which chair are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They both cost $449. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, we don't have anything like. Can I find you something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the sofa in the far left corner of the room next to the large red sofa?  It is by Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, both that rug and the white one in the far left corner of the room both have good customer ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are made of natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly, I've added it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> For rugs, I have the white one at the back under that red couch, and the red patterned rug toward the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Could you specify which rug you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug is $249 from Uptown Studio, and the red rug is $199 from Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> A the moment, it's just that red rug from Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the one in the back to the left of the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's made by StyleNow and has a rating of 4.9. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything to those specifications. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the white chair in the back right, the brown chair just to the left of the partition, and brown chair next to the grey table on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the wooden table to the left of the brown chair in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Could you clarify which one you are referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That table is from StyleNow Feed. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like this one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will do just that! Anything else I can help you with? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This is the only item I have from this brand. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I am sorry, I don't have any tables made from natural fibers. Is there anything else I can do for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly, would you be interested in tall shelves to the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, how do you feel about the white one in the back or perhaps the red one towards the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, that will be added to your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I could not find anything like that by Uptown Studio. <end>
<cls> <sep2> It doesn't seem like I do.  Was there anything else you were after? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm not sure exactly what you need. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, what do you think of the wooden table way at the back in the center? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, there's now one end table and one ottoman in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The ladder bookcases against the far partition match your search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's one you can look at to the left of the shop towards the back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which end tables can I tell you about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, they are both made from wood. The black one has a 3.7 rating and the white one has a 4.9 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the wooden ones against the back wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add them to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They're made of wood, and the brand is Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add that lamp and the rug to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the far white rug in back or the red rug by the dining table? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which rug would you like the price on? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That rug is made by Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I couldn't find anything to match your description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I have a white one and a red one. How do you like them? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I couldn't find anything like that. Is there something else I can do for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They're both made of leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They're both rated at 2.9 and cost $449. <end>
<cls> <sep2> On the green rug in front of the partition I have that wooden one which you might like. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No I don't have any leather end tables.  Is there anything else I could help you look for? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which two rugs are you asking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one is made by Uptown Studio, and the red one is made by Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white rug on the left, or maybe the red rug in the middle on the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add the white rug and the red rug to the cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's made by Uptown Studio and it's made of natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You're looking for sofa chairs with good ratings. I found a white one between the couches on the middle rug on the left, and the one between the rugs in front of the grey sofa on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything that fits that criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll add that table to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the grey sofa on the back left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at what I found. The wooden table in the background matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing came up for that search. What else can I do to help you today? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which table are you talking about? Can you specify it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It costs $399 and is from  StyleNow Feed. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the one on the rug in the middle on the left, or maybe the one in front of the couch at the front? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything fitting those specifications. Can I help you find anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the red area rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which chair are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Right, that couch chair is made with leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Confirmed. I will add them to the cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's that white one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Can you be more specific? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's made from natural fibers and costs $199. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Will do. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can help you! We have the brown chair on the right close to the end of the divider; another brown one in the  back, behind the second divider on the right; and the white chair next to the natural wood-colored table at the end of this room to the right . Do any of them look right for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They both have good ratings: the chair closer to us enjoys the high rating of 4.2, and the one further away is rated 3.2. The one closer to us is from 212 Local, and the other one is from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly! I will now put these chairs into your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The three chairs you saw today are the ones with high ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the brown table in the very back just to the left of the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I didn't find anything matching that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> It has a 3.2 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll do that for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the ones at the back in the middle? They're wooden. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That one is the only one with that rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything else fitting your criteria. What else can I help you find? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, adding two wooden shelves to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this white one and that red one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have that one over there and this one right here. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We don't have anything like that, sorry. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry there doesn't seem to be a sofa which fits that description. May I assist you in another way? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the brown chair in the back right and the white chair at the desk in the back as well as the brown chair in the center on the red rug. . <end>
<cls> <sep2> Alright then. I'll go ahead and put one white chair and one brown chair into your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've noted your request, and I'm adding one black and one white end table to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That would be the red rug in the middle of the floor in front of us and the white one at the end of the room to the left of us. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Either one of these would fit your style. <end>
<cls> <sep2> At this time, no area rug we have has both an expensive price and high ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly! I am adding it right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What are your thoughts on the grey sofa to the left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, there is the shorter, white couch chair on the left and the white couch chair just to the left of the grey couch. <end>
<cls> <sep2> OK, I'll add the brown chair in the back and white lamp to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> OK, I'll add another brown chair to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but we don't have any modestly priced tables. Is there some other search I can do for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have two expensive area rugs like that. You'll find a white area rug to the back left and a red area rug to the center right of the room. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which rug are you asking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's from Art Den. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the white couch chair in the background and the other white couch chair in the forefront? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I cannot find anything else that matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Alright, I will add that item to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I cannot find anything else that matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here is a white one and red one for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I only have those two rugs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are two white armchairs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, I am adding them now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a red one and this white one in the back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I will put them in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here is the white one that's already in  your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> OK, I will add it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we have any in that price range at  the moment.  Is there anything else you would like to see? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, it doesn't look like I have that right now either. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown chair is $299 and has a 4.2, the white chair is $499 and has a 4.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I'll add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one in the back left has the rating and brand you're looking for. <end>
<cls> <sep2> In addition to those, there's also a white chair near the back center wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one is rated much higher. It has a 4.9 while the black table has a 3.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the shelves near the white chair we looked at earlier? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Will the wooden table in the back match your kitchen? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course. I will put that white chair in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chair is white. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, can you describe which table you're curious about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That table on the greenish blue rug in the back is a great pick! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, there are no tables that satisfy your search criteria. Let me know if there is anything else I can do for you! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Are you sure I can't interest you in that wooden one back there? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think you could really love that grey one in the back or that red one to the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've got the white one at the far back of the room, as well as the red one on the right side. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing!  I'll add both rugs for you right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> For which items? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug is from Uptown Studio and made of natural fibers, while the red one is from Art Den, and also made of natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the backless white chair on the left or the one in the middle of the room? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the white rug in the back of the room, or the red near the partition? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem, I'm adding those now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'm adding another to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's this wooden one here. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Will do. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the white rug or the red rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red rug is from Art Den and costs $199 while the white rug is from Uptown Studio and costs $249. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the wooden table in the back and let me know what you think of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do not have any wooden shelves that are affordably priced. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one is by StyleNow Feed. The black one is by North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This one is made of wood and costs $549. <end>
<cls> <sep2> In the back most set, there's a white chair on the grey and blue rug, another brown chair on the red rug, and the other behind it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one is 4.7 while the brown is 3.2. Both are made of leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Their prices are different. The white one is $499 while the brown is $299. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can definitely help! What are your thoughts on the brown one all the way in the back to the right, the white one next to the wooden table or the other brown one on the red rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great, I will add both of those to your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm not sure which one you mean. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, that end table is priced at $399. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, there's one at the back left.  What do you think of it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which brown table? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure!  It's made by StyleNow Feed and rated 3.2. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do actually!  It's beyond the white ottoman in front of you.. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a white one on the left and a red one on the right. Tell me your thoughts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ah, yes, the left one is from Uptown Studio with a 3.0 rating and the other one's from Art Den with a 3.8 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Nothing came back from that search, my apologies. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, the white one in the far back on the left and the red one in the middle on the right both fit what you're looking for. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything to fit that search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both natural fiber rugs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok! I'll add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the brown chairs in the back? Or the white chair? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you talking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chair has a rating of 4.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing else matches your description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the ones over the gap in the dividers? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which chairs do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both leather. The swivel chair is significantly cheaper at $299. The other is $499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any of those in stock right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one in the back and the red one on the right have that rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, those are the only rugs with that rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure. I've added it for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> This Uptown Studio rug is priced at $249. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a red one straight ahead and a white one on the left in back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No matches came back with those criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, these are the only two we currently have in stock. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course. The red one is from Art Den with a 3.8 rating, the other from Uptown Studio with a 3.0 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly! All of my chairs are on the right, in the displays further down the room. First, on the right, on the red rug between two room dividers, you will see a chair in brown. If you look further in the same direction, you'll see another brown chair in the display on the right of the partition. Finally, in the display on the left side of the same partition, you will see a white chair. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That couch is the only one like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can recommend the white on in the furthest display on the left. Do you like it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure! You will see it in your cart in a moment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I found a red one in the center and a white one in  the back left that matches those criteria. What are your thoughts? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I couldn't find anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I have no information on that lamp. <end>
<cls> <sep2> By that brand, I have this bench chair between the two striped rugs, and a second white bench chair on the striped rug to the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You've got it! <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any Modern Arts chairs with a good rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course.  I'll update your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white rug in back on the left, or the red one just in front of the partition? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but I don't have any affordable sofas. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm not able to find anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I'll add that now, <end>
<cls> <sep2> You might consider the brown chair next to the table behind the partition, the white chair on the green rug in the back, or the brown chair on wheels. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which tables do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both accent tables are made of wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chair itself, as well as the other brown one and white one I showed you before. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sorry, no, I don't see any like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll add those to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> This collection has three chairs available: two brown chairs in the back right corner and a white one near the shelves. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure! I'll add that for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> All three of the chairs available in this collection are made from leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the white couch chairs? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I cannot find anything that matches that criteria. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Okay,  I will add another to your cart. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure! The white ones are from Uptown Gallery, and the brown from 212 Local. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the white one at the far back of the room, and the red patterned one at the right side of the room. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly!  I'll take care of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown chair is by Modern Arts, has a rating of 4.2, made of leather and is priced at $299.  The white chair is from Uptown Gallery, has a rating of 4.7, leather upholstery, and a price of $499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> It has a rating of 4.7, as I just said. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Ok, I can help you with that. I have a brown coat on the left wall display and a grey coat and a black coat on the right wall. What do you think of those? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black blouse is displayed in XL and the tri-colored blouse is displayed in XS. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have any other coats to recommend, nor any blouses. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I'm afraid the black blouse on the front rack is the only one that fits that description. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure, both coats cost $179.99, but the black one has a lower rating at 3.0 compared to the 3.8 rating on the light grey coat. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which items are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, the black coat is only available in size XL, but the grey coat is available in all sizes XS - XXL! <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the dark green joggers? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but those are the only items which match your criteria. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I don't have any dresses matching that description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The purple one is by Modern arts and is available in XS, S, M, XL, and XXL. The black one is by 212 Local and is available in large only. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Yes! What do you think of the white and grey blouse to the left at the top? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one above it might catch your eye. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Could you identify more precisely which dress has caught your eye? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That dress is a large and has on average been rated a 4.5 by other buyers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I advise you to also consider the red sweater on the lower row of that table, the maroon one next to it, and the other maroon sweater next to the other red sweater up top. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will happily add that red sweater to your cart! <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the violet dress in back on the right? <end>

<cls> <sep2> Which sweater would you like those details on? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That sweater is made by Garden Retail and sells for $154.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The maroon sweater closest to you is a medium, and it is the cheaper of the two, at $64.99. The other option is a large, and it costs $124.99. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Which dresses are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The maroon dress is rated 3.2 and the available sizes are XS, XL, L, S, XXL, and M. The brown and black dress is rated 3.9 and is rated XS, L, XL, and XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> These three dresses all have positive customer reviews. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey/white blouse to the right of that one is of a similar style. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those two are the only blouses in that style. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black top  you're looking at is a large, and the other is a small. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Either would be a great choice! <end>

<cls> <sep2> Yes, how about this purple dress on the right side of the floor rack? That is more affordable. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have any affordable dresses in size small. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I'll put those in your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Are you into that green one hanging behind the white shirt on the second floor rack? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay! What do you think of this purple one hanging on the right-hand side of the first rack to the left? <end>

<cls> <sep2> These hats are both by Ocean Wears. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't see any other shoes with XS sizing available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the brown coat on the circular rack on the left or the black coat on the circular rack in front. There's also a brown coat on the circular rack in the far back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a black coat on the rack in the back left and another one on the same rack. Otherwise the only other recommendation I have is the black coat on the circular rack in the center. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything like that. <end>

<cls> <sep2> The grey coat costs 59.99 and the light grey one costs 179.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing. <end>

<cls> <sep2> There's one in the far back right, one at the back of the rack at the front, and one on the rack behind the hats. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, those three are the only similar ones. <end>
<cls> <sep2> All right, I'll add that light grey coat now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you feel about this light grey one on the top right shelf of the right wall, this light grey one on the top middle shelf of the right wall, and the brown one in the front of the right floor rack? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They both come in an XL but the light grey one is more expansive at 179.99 than the brown one, priced at 59.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can help find an XL coat. Take a look at the light grey coat on the top middle shelf of the right wall, the light grey one on the back right of the right floor rack, and the brown one in the back of the right floor rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yep, I'll add both of those to your cart. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Which items are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. The black coat, displayed in size L, comes in XS, M, L, and XXL, while the grey coat, displayed in XXL, comes in XS, M, L, XL, and XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course! I have three grey and white blouses with light spots, what do you think of them? There's one in the left-most cubby, one in the next cubby to the right, and another in the third cubby from the far end. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, there's a black blouse towards the far end near the last grey and white blouse that might interest you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, I can! I have two plain jackets in size S, a brown jacket on the very left and a light grey one on the other side of the same cubby. What do you think of those? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I've added both items for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have anything else similar to that. Is there something else I can help with? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey trousers might be something you look into. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is available in XS and S and has a score of 3.5. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but no other item matches your search criteria. What else can I help you with? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about the light blue jeans? What do you think of them? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like the light blue pair in the leftmost cubby? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This one is available in small, extra large, and extra extra large. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the grey one in the cubby above the jeans and the brown one in the same cubby. They are both jackets. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will put them in your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I would be happy to help! What do you think about the blue and grey striped one, the orange and purple one to its left or the maroon one hanging in front of the window? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Besides those two striped ones, we have the violet one to the right. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, we have the blue and black ones all the way to the left and the dark blue ones right next to those. Let me know if any of those interest you! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Definitely, I will add that now! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great, I will add that to your cart now! <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the white vest in the back left corner. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you talking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's in L. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'll add it now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The middle one is rated 4.8 and it comes in XS, M, L, and XXL. The one to its right is rated 4.5 and it's rated XS, M, L, XL, and XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think you might be enamored with this grey jacket up front to the right, the red and white jacket at the left end of that rack in the middle of the floor, or the black option at the right end of the bottom row in the back near the windows. <end>
<cls> <sep2> In that case, turn your attention to the black coat hanging above the striped shirts in the back, the other black coat on the other side of that green sweater, and the brown coat to the left of those past the brown shirt. <end>
<cls> <sep2> If that hoodie caught your eye, perhaps you'd like to consider the green hoodie hanging on the top row in the very back or the blue hoodie at the front of that rack the other green hoodie is at. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Could you be more specific as to which hoodies you are requesting information on? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Alright, I've got that brand information you asked for. That green hoodie is made by Downtown Consignment, while the blue hoodie is made by Global Voyager. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think you may like the green hoodie on the back wall, the blue hoodie on the front rack or the green hoodie hanging next to the blue one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's some that I found. Take a look at the green shirt on the rack or the blue button up shirt on the center display. <end>
<cls> <sep2> This the closest option to what you want. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which item? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That shirt is by Uptown Studio and costs 29.99 <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white one on the hanging rack to your left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The blue one is from Global Voyager. The other is from Downtown Consignment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's the only one I have in that color. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the grey one on the rack or one of the black ones over on the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's another one on the wall, next to the green sweater and a brown one by the maroon shirt. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about this gray one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have another black one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They both come in S only. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both $169.99 and are displayed in S. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the grey coat on the back wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have two black jackets, on the left and on the back wall, and the grey and white one to the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I've placed both in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you looking at? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That comes in L, XS, XL, XXL, and M. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about this grey one on the center top rack of the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't see any items like that, unfortunately. Could I help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yep, I can add that to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The blue one is available in sizes XL, S, M, and XXL, and the black one is available in size S. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'll add both of them to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can help you find that. I have this black one on the back bottom wall, the brown one next to it, and the black one hanging on the center rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black one is rated 4.9 and is available in M, L, XL, and XXL. The purple one is rated 2.7 and is available in XS, L, and XL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the grey and white jacket on the top right, the blue jacket on the center rack in the back, and the black jacket next to it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes. I will add those now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about this black one on the top rack of the back wall, or this black one on this floor rack? They are both medium sized dresses. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't see anything that meets that criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I can add that to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is a size M, priced at 229.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this gray one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are three options in black. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have any black coats with good reviews. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one on the wall is available in XS, L, and XL. The one on the rack is available in L, XL, and XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like the black one on the front left rack? It is a sweater. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I show you that. I have the black dress hanging up on the right wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one on the wall is rated 3.3. The one on the left is rated 3.9. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, I will put it in your cart for you. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Which item are you talking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey coat on the right is available in XXL and the other is in XS. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The only difference I can tell you now is the same size difference. <end>

<cls> <sep2> There is a white vest which matches your criteria. It is on the bottom rack in the back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Confirmed. They will be added to your cart for you. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure, hanging up in the bottom right corner is a brown hoodie. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, those items are now in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, there's a brown coat you can see between the two pairs of jeans.  In fact, the jacket you just pointed out has a plain pattern, as does the grey coat behind it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's the white vest you already added to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great, I've put it in your cart! <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have this white one on the bottom of the back wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. <end>

<cls> <sep2> These jeans are by Yogi Fit and cost $154.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's a white vest to the back and right under the red shirt that you may like. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, no. <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's the only white vest we have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the two jeans on the table display? If not that, there's a pair you might be able to see in the gap of the left one's pant legs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I didn't find any others. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can help you find a plain jacket. Take a look at the blue item behind the grey vest and the two light grey jackets on top of the back wall. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I will add those items to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure!  What do you think of the black coat in the back left corder? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They're both a size S.  The closer hat is rated just 2.6, while the one further away is rated at 4.4. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Was that for the hats? <end>

<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but I don't have anything of the sort.  Could I help you find any other items today? <end>

<cls> <sep2> Just the one I showed you earlier. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, how do you like the black and white hats closest to you on the left shelf?  If you do want a lighter color, the white hat on the right shelf would also be a good option. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the black coat hanging on the rack just past the left hat display, or the black coat across from it on the other rack.  Are either of those of any interest?  If you're looking for a more professional look, the brown coat on the near left rack would be an excellent choice as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, there's also another black coat next to the first one I mentioned, and one in the far cubby on the left side of the room that you might be able to get a better look at.  I also have a grey coat in the near cubby on your right that you might be interested in. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Can you clarify which blouses please? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The pink and white blouse is rated 4.5 and is available in XS, XL, and XXL. The holiday blouse is available in XS, M and L and is given a rating of 2.9. <end>

<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the dark blue jeans on the left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's the only one like it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which shirt do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's from Uptown Studio. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the black and red in the back or the grey and blue on the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The green hoodie on the rack matches your criteria. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Can you clarify which hats you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one in the middle is a small and the one in the front is a small. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I woul d suggest the green one on the left of the floor rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black hat is cheaper, at 4.99. The grey one costs 19.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I am not finding anything like that. Would you like to look for anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the blue jacket on the floor hanger on the left? It comes after the green hooded sweater. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure! I am adding it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I would definitely take a look at the green one on the left side of the floor rack at the far end of the table. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I would recommend two jackets on left of the floor rack, on the blue one on teh left of the green hoodie and the grey one on the right of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The blue one is in S, and the grey one in XS. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have no other jackets, unfortunately. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Which ones do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both size S. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the grey one under the blue shoeboxes, the grey and white one on the rack on the right, or maybe the blue one on the right of that same rack? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I also have a light grey jacket on the left hand rack, a light grey jacket on the front of that rack, and a blue jacket. <end>

<cls> <sep2> That is a L, and made by Cats Are Great. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There are two brown options in the rack on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That coat is similar to itself, as well as a black coat on the rack on the other side of the hat display, and the light grey coat on the rack on the right in the rack closer to the front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There are three light grey options on the rack to the left of the hat display. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Both of these jackets are available in S, XL, and XXL and are made by 212 Local. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That blue one at the right end of that set of shelves in the back to the left is a great choice, as is the green hoodie hanging to the left of it. You also can't go wrong with the blue one hanging on the rack to the right of the shelf with the hats on top. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but there are no denim hoodies in that color. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That blue hoodie is made by Global Voyager, while Downtown Consignment is the brand that makes the green one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What are your thoughts on that brown pair in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I wish I could help, but there are no jackets matching that description. <end>

<cls> <sep2> The near coat is available in sizes XS, M, L, XL, and XXL, and costs $109.99.  The far coat is available only in size XL, and costs $179.99. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure!  There's one at the far end of the shelving unit hanging above the jeans.  The other is hanging on the round rack at the far end of the counter with the hats on it. <end>

<cls> <sep2> The two grey beds at the wall on the right are good. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Nice! I am now putting it into you cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Got it! The second chair will be added in a moment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are two you might like. <end>

<cls> <sep2> The custormer rating of this item is 3.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown chair is $299 and the black and white one is $499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, how do you like the grey table on the left with the two chairs behind it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly, I've added both beds to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Could you clarify which piece you're referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That bed is made with memory foam, and the brand is StyleNow Feed. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have these short wooden shelves front and center that might be a good fit. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any expensive leather shelves.  Anything else you'd care to see? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't seem to have any of those either, my apologies.  Anything else I could try to find you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll update your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> On the green rug, the bed to the left, and the bed to the right might both match your style.  What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the wooden shelves against the short partition. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing.  I'm adding it for you now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly.  They're in your cart as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown chair next to the black table is expensive. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both of these grey beds are in stock. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which chair are you interested in? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chair has a customer rating of 3.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I suggest those two grey beds on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly! I have put it into your cart. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Certainly! I will add this chair to your cart right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Check these out and see what you think. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything else to show you at the moment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Good choice! I'll add that to your basket. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I wasn't able to find anything like that, unfortunately. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What are you thoughts on the grey island-like table? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I will add that grey table to the cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Right! That is a $649 table with a 3.3 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Please consider the black and white chair and the brown one next to the kitchen island. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown one matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both of the beds in this view fit that description. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, I'll add that one to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have two I can show you. Please direct your attention to the mattresses to the back against the wall and to the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Well, actually both are gray and both are memory foam. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately no, and I actually don't have anything that matches that query. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Since you like grey, might I recommend these two options? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at these when you have a chance. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Will do! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I'll update the quantity. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You might like the white one under the kitchen island. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which item would you like to know about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That rug has a 3.0 rating and sells for $249. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The shelves up against the wall on the left, on the rug we were looking at, fit what you're looking for. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have two beds for you to check out, both in color grey. You can see them by the wall on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, both these beds have memory foam mattresses. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the brown chair in the display to the left, standing on the left of the gray table facing away from us. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I cannot find anything else.  Would you like to start a new search? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the wood shelves right off the divide? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you talking abou? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chair costs $649. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both made out of memory foam and cost $599. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like these ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black and white chair is $499 and it is rated at 3.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown chair is rated at 4.2 and it is made from leather. The black and white one is also made with leather and it is rated at 3.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How is this grey bed on the back wall? I also have another grey option on the right wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, those are the only two options. <end>
<cls> <sep2> This white rug on the left could work. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How are these wooden shelves just in front of you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> There are two at the back of the room on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's all the beds for now unfortunately. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, which bed did you want that information for? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, they're actually both made of memory foam and are rated at 3.9 <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have these two grey ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those two beds are the only ones we have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both rated at 3.9 and cost $599. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have a white rug one on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, we don't have any rugs from Uptown Studio. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, those are the only two beds we have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Either the grey bed in front of you or the grey bed to the right may be of interest. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We don't carry anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug on the left is by Uptown Studio. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I've updated your cart to reflect the white Uptown Studio rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the wood shelves right here in front? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> In addition to that brown one you might like the black and white one to the right of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are leather. The brown one has a 4.2 rating, while the black and white one has a 4.2 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown chair on the left is by Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think the brown chair on the left will suit your needs best. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown chair is closest to your search requirements, but I can also recommend the black and white chair next to it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I see you are interested in shelves. You may want to look at the wooden shelves in front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those two grey beds against the back wall have memory foam mattresses! Can you see yourself sleeping on one of those? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sounds good! I'll add both of those grey beds to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but there are no more beds made with memory foam for you to browse. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You got it. I'm adding another grey bed to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can help with that. I have these two options in the back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any like that, sadly. Something else you would like to see? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can recommend these two in the back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will do that now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, it's now in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which brown chair? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, it's $299. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'll add both chairs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but nothing I could find has a good rating and leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the two grey beds against the back wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, there's one in the back right corner, then another up against the wall on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Actually, both of those beds have good ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, the bed is in your cart.  Do you want anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, the rug and bookcase are now in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, we don't have any StyleNow Feed beds in the affordable range. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which gray table are you asking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That table is made of wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I don't have any good, affordable beds from StyleNow Feed, unfortunately. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I've got that gray bed with the headboard, and the other gray bed to the right of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing.  I'll put that into your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I don't have any expensive, well-reviewed beds from Uptown Studio. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've double checked, and I have no expensive beds from that brand. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do actually!  Both of the beds over to the right are made by that company. <end>
<cls> <sep2> For which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't mind at all!  Especially considering they actually have matching ratings of 3.9. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of this short brown bookcase right in front of you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the brown one next to the island? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both of them are made from leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, no others are available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure. They're both sitting in your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the ones on the left? They have a good rating and are made by Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> See what you think of the brown chair on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add the chair and shelves to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll add that chair right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black and white one facing the back kitchen island is the brand you're looking for. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You might like the white one that the black and white chair is sitting on. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll add it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That one I showed you, the one under the chair, is from that brand. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, take a look at that brown chair on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, in addition to that brown chair, I also have this black and white chair next to it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, it's in there now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I've updated your cart to add the black and white chair as well. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Aside from the brown one, I can show you that innovative black and white chair at the same island. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about this gray table on the left side of the striped rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you asking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That table is made of wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think that that gray one would be an ideal choice for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like these? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which table do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It can be yours for $649. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I am sorry but I don't have anything that would match your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have two beds, both of them are at the back right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I don't have anything like that, sorry! <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure, your cart has been updated. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think of the two grey beds on the green rug up against the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly, I've added it to your cart.  Is there anything else I can help you find? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both beds are made by the brand StyleNow Feed. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't currently have any rugs in the cheap price range. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the bed against the back wall, or the one to the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything like that. Maybe I can help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything else to show you right now. Perhaps something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'm adding that for you now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's a brown option, or a black and white one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brown one from Modern Arts has a 4.2 rating, and the black and white one from 212 Local has a 3.7 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which brown one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is leather. <end>

<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the blue one in the back right rack, the black one in the front rack, and the light grey one in the middle left rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, do you like the blue jeans in the leftmost cubby of the middle dresser? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Nothing I found matches that. Wanna look again? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I don't see anything else, sorry. Wanna search again? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both an XL and have full sleeves. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have one on the front of the second carousel from the left and two more, each on the left side of the two carousels on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have one each in the sixth and eighth cubicles on the bottom. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, these are the only ones we have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They both rate 4.0. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll make sure that's in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Could you see yourself wearing that black one hanging up near the purple dress on the rack, the other black one hanging on the wall to the right, or the grey dress to the left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> In that case, allow me to suggest the black and grey dress to the left, the purple dress on the right-hand side of that rack, and the black dress further back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which dresses would those be? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both of those grey dresses are extra extra larges. The one closer up costs $94.99, and the other one costs $124.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That black one in the back to the right is similar. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like the grey and white vest displayed on the center table? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey coat is available in XS, L, XXL and priced at 59.99. The brown one is available in XS and XL and priced at 59.99. <end>

<cls> <sep2> May I recommend the purple one at the far end of the top row on the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I cannot find anything in these colors. Would you like my help with another search? <end>
<cls> <sep2> First, in the top row on the right, take a look at  the grey coat next to the purple shirt; then, in the same row take a look at the brown coat  that hangs second to last on the right. Then, in the bottom row, find another brown jacket in the middle. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Got it! These items will be in your cart in a second. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I only have that shirt. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like these ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like these ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have one more item you might be interested in. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you think of this coat? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like these coats I showed you before? <end>

<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's by Coats & More. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the light blue ones second from the back, the ones at the front left, or the ones in the back corner? Those are all jeans. <end>

<cls> <sep2> For expensive jeans in L, I found the light blue jeans I showed you before and the light blue jeans below the beige jacket. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have a green one on the left side of the wall. Do you like it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but that kind of item doesn't seem to be available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, there were no results for that search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have a grey pair to the right of the mirror. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have a light grey one next to that hoodie, a red and white one in the third section from the end of the wall, and a grey one in the section behind it. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I do, take a look at the dark green joggers in the fourth cubby from the right on the left wall, and the joggers in the first cubby from the left on the right wall.  Both are size XL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which pair are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those joggers are made by the brand Downtown Consignment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any joggers in size XL in the affordable price range. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like the black coats in the fourth and third cubbies from the right on the left wall?  The black coat hanging up on the rack in the middle of the room would also be worth checking out. <end>
<cls> <sep2> At the front left of the garment rack, I've got the green one, and the brown one to the right side. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The green one has a 2.8 rating and costs $114.99, the brown one has a 4.0 and costs $144.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both the brown and green hoodies have similar patterns. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Aside from jacket itself, I have the gray jacket hanging closest to the door, and the gray and white jacket hanging next to the red and white one in the third cabinet from the door. <end>

<cls> <sep2> There are several jackets which match your criteria. Take a look and let me know what you think. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a grey one towards the back on the right and a white one in the center. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a red one in the center and a grey one way back on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey one is $449 and the white one is$499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I'll put that in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's teh grey area rug and the white area rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey area rug has a rating of 3.8 while the white rug has a rating of 3.6. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can't find anything that matches your search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, no other item matches your parameters. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white one in the middle of the room? <end>
<cls> <sep2> There aren't any affordable chairs available right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Can you be more specific? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That one is made by Modern Arts and runs $399. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, how is that one in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like this white one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. The gray one has a 3.8 rating and is made from wool.  The white one has a 3.6 and is made from natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I don't have any rugs in that price range?   Would you like to search for something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, there are several in those colors.  Could you specify which ones you want to know about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red one is made of leather and has a 4.9 rating, while the gray one has a 3.1 rating and is also made of leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I don't have any sofas that fit your specifications. <end>
<cls> <sep2> As far as rugs, I have two that might interest you. The first is the white rug to the left under the red sofa, and the second is the grey rug further behind it to the right under a shelf. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, sorry, neither have that exact criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those are the two top rugs to offer. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Got it. I'll add one of each rug to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have this white accent chair at the bottom right corner of the diamond patterned rug.  What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course.  I'll add that lamp for you right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which sofa? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, that sofa is $599 and made by River Chateau. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the grey one in the back left or the red in the middle of the room? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red one goes for $599 and has a rating of 4.9, while the grey is $399 and has a 3.1 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white one beside the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Absolutely, I'll add that to your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think of the grey rug at the back to the left of the partition? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, they're both now in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, the red one is from River Chateau, while the grey one is from Modern Arts? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately I don't see anything like that right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a green chair that may interest you in the back against the wall to the left of center. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which red sofa? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It has a 4.9 and costs $599. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I didn't find anything. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the grey rug in the back center of the room and the white one in the front center. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but those are the only two available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey one in back is woolen and the white is made from natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug in front is by Home Store. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the closest white chair just to the left of the grey loveseat? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, we can't find anything like that. How else can I help you with that? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That one is $499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the green chair at the back on the gray rug.  What do yo think of that one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> In wool, I have that gray rug under the green chair I showed you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> For which item? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That rug has a price of $499, and is made by North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course! You might like the grey one in the back, or the red one on the black and white rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I can't find what you're looking for. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything red leather from North Lodge that is also cheap. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which lamp? <end>
<cls> <sep2> These rugs aren't in the budget range. <end>
<cls> <sep2> These are the only items like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add the end table and green chair you like to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay. I've added those items as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Why don't you give that grey one in the very back or the long red one a try? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Aside from the grey one I previously mentioned, there are no other options like it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which item are you requesting details about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly. Those sofas are both made with leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white one directly next to the middle rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything. Can I help you find anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add that white sofa chair to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one in front costs $549, and the one in the back costs $399. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey one on the far left and the red one are both in the high-end range. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add one white rug to your shopping cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> These rugs are rated at 3.6 and made with all natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I couldn't find anything to meet that description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of this green one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is made of natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Alright, I will add it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the green chair at the back against the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can't find any expensive white chairs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add them now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Adding a second green chair and a second white chair to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like this green one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any items matching those criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Adding to cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of this gray rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like the white accent chair on the right, by the end of the divider? It is made by Downtown Stylists. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think you may like the green chair next to the grey desk in the back of the room on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I am not finding anything else. Is there anything else I can help you find? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure! They will be in your cart in a moment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We've got this green one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chair is the only one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's this white one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the grey sofa over to the right in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's made of leather and costs $399. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Well, as stated, it is $399, and it is from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find anything with all of those criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black table has a 3.7 rating, whereas the other has a 3.3. Both are made of wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white chair towards the front by the black and white rug could work. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing. Adding it now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I found one sofa chair that might interest you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one  is made from natural fibers by Home Store and the grey one is made from wool by North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one  do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The rqting is 3.3. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the one on the right in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about that one I mentioned, or the white one in the front? Both are rugs with good ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug is $449 and made of natural fibers, and the grey rug is $499 and made of wool. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, I'll add that table and the rug to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem. What do you think of the leather armchair to the left of the two grey couches? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any others to show you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Will do! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll add it to your cart as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You might like the green chair in the back corner straight ahead, next to the shelves. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, no chair is by that brand, green, and made of natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but we don't have anything similar to that. Do you want to search again? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I sure will! <end>
<cls> <sep2> The rug in the front on the left may be what you're looking for, the black and white one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem, what about the one in the back, to the left of the partition? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, the wooden one is from Modern Arts and costs $399 and the black one is from North Lodge and costs $549. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course. They are both made of wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How does that beautiful green one in the back right suit you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, that is the only Home Store chair I can identify. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have two sofas to show you. Are you receptive to that grey one in the very back or the long red sofa on the white lined rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm glad you found something that pleases you! I will add the chair and the table to your cart for your convenience. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have this one in grey and this one in red. <end>
<cls> <sep2> These are the only two sofas I have right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Nothing with a 3.1 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey has a 3.8 rating and runs $499. The white one is rated 3.6 and goes for $449. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course! Have a look at the green one towards the back by the ladder bookcase. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey one under that green chair and the black and white one in the middle of the room may be of interest to you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which sofa are you looking at? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, both are leather and  the red sofa is from River Chateau and the grey one is from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I have a red couch on the white and grey patterned rug, as well as a grey couch at the back left of the room. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem!  I'll add it right away.  Can I help with anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Just the red one I mentioned earlier. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I've updated your cart to include a second unit of the same couch. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about this grey one in the back of the room, and the white rug in the center? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug in the middle is from Home Store and has a 3.6 rating. The grey has a rating of 3.8  and is from North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have this green chair in the back of the room. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem, I'll add those to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this green chair? It fits your requirements. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's a white one for you to consider. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I will add both to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the white one in the middle? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find any sofa chairs by Downtown Stylists. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the green chair on the back right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The only one I can find is the white sofa chair I showed you earlier. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the gray sofa at the far back in the middle of the blue and tan rug, and I also have the red sofa on the diamond patterned rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I don't have any chairs in that price range. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, we don't currently have any affordable chairs with good customer ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I'm on it! <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can show you the grey sofa in the back and the red sofa in the middle of the room. Do you have any opinions of them? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, that is the only option available that matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I cannot find anything that matches your new search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, no. I cannot find any item which matches your new search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the grey one behind the lamp in the middle or the red one in the middle? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, that's the only item like it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> All right, I'll add that red sofa to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add another sofa to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think of the grey one way at the back, or maybe this white one towards the front with a  red couch on it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Definitely, we have a white chair just at the front right corner of the white rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately I don't have anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'll update your cart accordingly. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't seem to find anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, adding one sofa chair and one lamp to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> In addition to that black one, there's also a wooden one right beside it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes it is. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about the green chair in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What item are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It has a rating of 2.9 and is made out of natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the grey area rug and the white area rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the green chair in the background? It's an expensive chair. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, no, I can't find anything else that matches those search parameters. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The wooden end table has a rating of 3.3, costs $399, and is from Modern Arts while the black end table has a rating of 3.7, costs $549, and is from North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Can you specify which end table you are referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the green chair? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red sofa has a customer rating of 4.9 while the grey one has a rating of 3.1. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are curious about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That sofa has a rating of 4.9. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the white couch chair up front here? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing we have is similar to those. Do you want anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, adding those now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Gotcha, adding those now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I found this white couch chair for you. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which lamp are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That white lamp is made out of metal and is from Global Voyager. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add those items to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course! You might consider the black and white one that the red couch is sitting on or the white one on the left side of the partition wall in the back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any others to show you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which rug would you like to hear about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black and white one is made of natural fibers and costs $449 and the grey one is made of wool and costs $499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's the white couch chair. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Confirmed. I'll add it to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll refer you to the grey sofa in the background. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add both of those to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, we don't have any affordable couch chairs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That black end table is the only black one we have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black end table is a wooden North Lodge table with a rating of 3.7 and priced at $549. The wooden table behind it is a Modern Arts design with a 3.3 customer rating priced at $399. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red sofa is $599 and the gray is $200 less than than that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the grey sofa and the red sofa? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add the red sofa to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The green chair in the back is made out of natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add two of those sofas to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's the grey one and this red one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The mahogany colored one is from Modern Arts and the rating is 3.3. It costs $399. The other one is from North Lodge and is rated at 3.7. It costs $549. They are both made of balsa wood. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, will do. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, check out that one in the back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, will do. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything that matches all of those criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is the grey area rug in the back and the white one in the forefront that might catch your eye. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing else matches your description. Can I help you in any other way? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add that item to your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing can be found which matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like either the black and white one in  the center or the grey one to the back and right of it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one in the center is natural fiber and has a 3.6 rating, while the other is wool and has a 3.8 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, those are the two options I have like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I'll set those in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You may like the geometric print one up front or the grey one in back by the partition. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, for which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. The one up front is natural fiber and made by Home Store. The one in back is wool and made by North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think you will find that the grey sofa in the back left corner and the long red sofa on the white zig-zag rug exceed your expectations. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, could you be more specific about which item you are interested in? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey sofa is made by Modern Arts and sells for $399. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I certainly can! It will be in your cart momentarily. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like either the grey in back or the white on the left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which piece do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's from Home Store. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Nothing like that is currently available. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug under the red sofa is made from natural fibers. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, there aren't any others that match your search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which items did you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red one is the River Chateau brand. The grey one is Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I certainly can!  If you look in the back left corner you can see a grey couch.  Still on the left side but towards the middle of the room is a red one.  What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any Home Store couches currently. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are made of leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Perfect, they've both been added to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this green one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about this grey one? It matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which piece are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's from North Lodge and it costs $499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you think the one in the center would work for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's leather with a 4.4 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, but nothing comes up in that search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I would suggest the gray couch on the left at the far back, or the red couch on the white geometric rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I don't have any further leather couches in stock. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I think you might like to see the white one at the corner of that geometric rug. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly.  I'll add that to your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do!  There's a grey one straight back in front of the partition wall, and a white one in the center of the room. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which one did you want that information for? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, it's rated 3.6 and costs $449. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly, I've added two white rugs to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the gray one in back or the red one in the middle? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like that green one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything else. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I showed you the two options I have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You might like the green one in the back behind the ladder bookcase. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Have a look at the red one facing away on the black and white rug or the grey one to the back left of the shop. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Excellent! I'll add both to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are leather sofas. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have these two white ones. Do you like either? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything that matches that criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The green chair in the middle has good ratings, do you see yourself in it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Confirmed. I'll put that in your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How is this grey rug in the very back on the left side of the divider, or the other white rug in the center of the room? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do not have anything besides those two sofas. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add them right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Your cart is now full. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can definitely help! What do you think about the grey one to the left in the back or the red one to the right and closer to the front? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, would you be interested in something like the grey one towards the back on the right, or maybe a white one with a pattern like the one in the center? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I couldn't find any area rugs meeting your preferences. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, for chairs, perhaps the nice bright green one in the back and to the right. What are your thoughts on that one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Have you seen this one yet? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about these two rugs? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll go ahead and put those in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can certainly do that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the green chair by the partition? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's the only chair I can suggest. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white sofa chair in the front of the room? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, I'll add it for you now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the red one in the middle and the one way back on the left. Do you have an opinion on  them? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll get that one in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, those are the only two ones alike. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly, how do you like the armchair on the right next to the small grey sofa?  It has a good customer rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The geometric white and black rug under the red sofa is by Home Store.  How do you like it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but I don't have any grey rugs by Home Store. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I've added the white and black rug to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem. What do you think of the green one in back by the separator wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That rug or the black and white one nearer to us might interest you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any that fit your request. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That end table is the only one that fits your search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, there's one like that,  you can see it right in the centre of your view. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, there's a couple.  Over to the left you can see a grey rug, and at the back just in front of the partition wall there's a white one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Actually, both of those ones have good ratings.  There's nothing else like that though. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Perfect, I've added those to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Welcome. What do you think of the grey sofa in the back on the left or why red sofa on the black and white striped rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That is a $399 Modern Arts sofa. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the green chair near the partition? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, we don't have chairs in that price range. Anything else you want to see? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This white one is the only one like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, we don't have anything like that. Anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem! What do you think about the green one in back on this side of the dividing wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything similar. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, just that green one I showed you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! Adding those to your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You can think about the white chair next to the grey couch. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a closer look at the grey sofa in back or the red sofa in front. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, we don't have anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I have added the table and chair for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white chair in front of you may be worth a closer look. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which chair are you asking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That chairs is made by Downtown Stylists. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find any chairs like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> In leather settees, I have the red one on the geometric rugs, and the gray one at the far back closest to the wall. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The red one is by River Chateau, and the gray one is by Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing!  The rug's being added to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> My apologies, but I don't have any items like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like the grey one in the back or the red one in the center? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I'll do that now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> This is what I have in that color. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You got it. I'll add it now. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Sure, the grey chair has a rating of 4.8 and the white's is 4.2. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I would suggest the white rug in the middle of the room. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I can't seem to find any cheap shelves made by 212 Local. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are items like the white chair. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this white couch chair in the very back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those have been added to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, but can I help you find something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I also don't have anything like that. <end>

<cls> <sep2> They are both leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything matching that description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug in the center is made by Uptown Studio. What do you think? <end>

<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's by Global Voyager. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have these in the back by the table you looked at earlier. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> You may like the white armchair on our immediat left, the grey one a bit ahead and to the right, and another grey chair at the far end of the next display, on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey chair from Downtown Stylists enjoys the higher rating of 4.8. The white chair from Downtown Consignment  is rated 4.2. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Got it! I am adding these items to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure! I will add them now. <end>

<cls> <sep2> Both of those lamps are metal. <end>

<cls> <sep2> What do you think about this one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one in the back has an average rating of 3.1 and the one in the front has a rating of 4.2. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry but I couldn't find any chairs like that. <end>

<cls> <sep2> I have one grey chair in the back center, another grey on the right, and a white chair in the front left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I wasn't able to find any leather chairs with a good rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which items do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both are made of wood. The white costs $399 and the black $549. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Any interest in that first beige option to the left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add that for you right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, there are no further results. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You sure can! I'll place that in your cart as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have several for you to look at. What do you think of  the grey one under the white lamp in front, the grey one facing forward on the right, or the white one to the back of the light colored rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those three are the only ones that fit your search. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those are the only three appropriate chairs that I have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll add those to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Let me help you find a shelving unit with good customer ratings. I've found this wooden shelf in the back right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course. I've added one black end table to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but I could not find any brown shelves made by Modern Arts with good customer ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be any shelving units on display meeting your request for wooden shelves by 212 with good customer ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, what do you think about this white one in the middle? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have this white one, what do you think of it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm afraid this is the only one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll put those in your cart right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've noted your request for wooden shelves. Take a look at the shelves in the back right of the display. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you referring to, please? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've looked up the customer rating to be 4.4. This item costs $499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can recommend you the shelves in the back right of the store. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think of the white rug about halfway back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, just those two items. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, it's now in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, was that for the chair I just put in your cart? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what about those wooden shelves in the back on the far right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of this white area rug just right of center? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything in that color. Can I help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what are your thoughts on this brown table on the right in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the white chair in the back right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I didn't find any other leather chairs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The lamp in front of it might work. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Got it, adding to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Since you're in the market for shelves, let me suggest this wooden shelf near the brown table to the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I will add those to the cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, it doesn't look like we have anything like that. Is there something else I can help you find? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'll add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about these? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is made by North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are expensive sofa chairs I found. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What about this brown one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about either of those gray ones or the white one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything else. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Will do. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Would you consider that table in the back to the right? It's neutral brown color would blend well with anything! <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm afraid that's the only table here. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Actually, that table in the back is made by Modern Arts! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Alright, I'll add the table to your cart for your convenience. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Would you be interested in a white chair? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which brown table do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That table by Modern Arts has customer rating of 3.5. <end>
<cls> <sep2> We don't carry any other Modern Arts wooden chairs,  unfortunately. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, first off there's a grey chair way at the back on the white and grey rug.  Next is another grey chair that's partially cut off at the right edge.  Lastly, we have the white chair at the bottom left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, which two do you mean?  I presented three. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They both will set you back $349. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They're again the same, being made by Downtown Stylists. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the white one on the left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one is rated 4.9 and the black one, 3.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I'll add it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the grey couch chair in the left middle set, the other grey one in the back right set, and the white one in the very front with the button-tufted upholstery? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but nothing else fits that criteria. Do you want something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing! <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, take a look at this one in the back right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Will do! <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, unfortunately I can't find anything that fits that criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I'll add those right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's a brown one for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here is a white one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any chairs that meet those criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have any. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Why don't you check out the grey chair on the right and the grey one behind the black couch. I would also suggest the white couch up front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add these to your cart right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I suggest the two you have chosen. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I couldn't find chairs specifically with good ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the table in the very back to the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find anything else matching that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The table in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is from Modern Arts and is wooden. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the white chair in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think about the shelf in the back? The one against the divide. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing else matches your criteria. How else may I be of assistance? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Differences include the facts that  the white sofa chair is from Downtown Consignment, has a rating of 4.2 and is white while the other is from Downtown Stylists, has a rating of 4.8, and is grey.  Both are made of leather and cost $349. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the grey sofa chair on the left on the rug, the grey chair at the front right, or even the white one at the front next to the lamp? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They're both made of leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's made by Downtown Stylists. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a brown table in the back that matches your description. What do you think of it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but nothing matches your description. Is there any other way I can help? <end>
<cls> <sep2> There are two grey sofa chairs that match your description. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They both have a rating of 4.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok! What do you think of those shelves in the far back on the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, those are the only ones available. Can I help you with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I'll add them to your cart right away! <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I'm afraid we don't have anything with that description. Is there something else I can help with? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are three, the first and third on the left and the one on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of these all the way in  the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I have no search results for those criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, no matches on that search either. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have the gray chair at the corner of the white striped rug, the other gray one in the front right, and the white one with the pillow at the front left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black one is $399 from StyleNow Feed, the white one is $549 from North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> My apologies, but I don't have any brown padded chairs by 212 Local. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm happy to help, sure thing. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those wooden ones in the back on the dark multicolored rug are made by that brand! <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, but I don't have any similar items with higher ratings to offer you today. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Those wooden shelves on the dark rug are still the only option. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I'll stick that in your cart for your convenience. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the wood shelves in the back? They match your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I could not find anything that matched your description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will add them to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I could not find anything that matched your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course! For sofa chairs, we have the grey one in the middle there across from the red sofa, another grey one closer to the front to the right and a white one in front of that to the left. Do any of those suit your preferences? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, which one did you want to know that for? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, the one in the back has a customer rating of 4.8, while the one closer to right has a rating of 4.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, the only ones we have in that style is that one and the one across from the red sofa. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Have you seen this one yet? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem, I'll put that in your basket. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's a few for you to check out. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will certainly do that! Let me know if I can be of any further assistance. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, how do you like the grey one in the back, the grey one closer to the front or the white one in the very front? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, those are the only lamps we have that are of that price. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I'm sorry. We don't have any other lamps priced at $549. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great! I will add both of those to your cart now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the one against the wall back there? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one in the back is from StyleNow Feed and is rated 4.9. The other is a 3.7 from North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the brown one in the corner? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay. They're in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Whatc do you think of the first white rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, nothing matches those parameters. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like this rug? It's made of that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I'll put that in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> ERROR <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I cannot find anything similar. What else do you need help with? <end>
<cls> <sep2> ERROR <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, I will also add that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I cannot find anything that matches your criteria. What else can I do to be of assistance? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the white rug in the middle of the room and tell me what you think. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, it will be added. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You got it. Another will be added to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Cool! Let's start with that white chair in the back. What are your thoughts? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both of those pieces are made with leather. <end>
<cls> <sep2> You got it! I'll put those items in your cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white lamp at the edge of the grey rug is more expensive. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's a white one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I only have the one expensive option to show you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything else. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which rug? <end>
<cls> <sep2> There are several grey sofa chairs you might like, along with a white sofa chair. Take a look at what I found. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, they will be added to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, no other items match your description aside from the already mentioned ones. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the brown table in the back. What do you think of it? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what about this white area rug in the center? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course, I'll do so right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything matching that description. Can I help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I'll add those to your cart as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like this white one I found? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem, I'll add that now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white rug is by that brand. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem, I'm adding that rug to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The white one in the middle is. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The first one is the brand River Chateau. The one in the back is Global Voyager. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I suggest checking out the brown table next to the shelves. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing. I'll add it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like this white one? It is made by Uptown Studio and has a good customer rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one in the front is $549 and the other one is $349. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add those to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add those to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can help with that. DO you like these wooden ones in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will add that now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that. Can I help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will add that one, too. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the brown table in the last display in this room on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I am sorry, I don't have any other highly-rated brown tables from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have any pieces with these characteristics today. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly! I am adding this table to your cart  as we speak. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can suggest three armchairs. First, the white one on our immediate left. Second, the grey one at the far end of the next display in front of us. Finally, the gray chair a little away from us on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I am not sure which end tables you are looking at, could you rephrase? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Thank you! I have this information for you: the black end table  from North Lodge is rated 3.7;  the white end table from StyleNow Feed enjoys a much higher rating, 4.9. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I can see no high-end armchairs. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the brown one in the back with the decorative legs? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you asking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That retails for $499. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sounds good.  I'll update your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about those wooden ones in the back against the right wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry I don't have any wooden shelves. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That one is rated 3.0. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's that white one. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I can't find anything like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which couch chair? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's rated 4.2. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How is this white one in the middle of the room? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything quite like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do not have anything that meets all those parameters. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't. <end>
<cls> <sep2> At the back right corner, I have those low wooden shelves that you might like. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Near the shelves you just saw, I've got that white chair that may work for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great.  I'm adding it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing.  I'll add that accent chair as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's two grey ones on the floor, and a white one up here in the front. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That one has a good rating. So does the grey one in the front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the one along the back wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay. It's in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the wooden shelf on the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the white couch chair on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, sorry. What else can I search for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> OK, I will add that to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the blue jacket on the top row, second from the back, as well as the light grey one right beneath it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Not that I could find, sorry! Anything else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find anything. Wanna search again? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The maroon one is by Garden Retail and is in L while the black one is in XL and by Downtown Consignment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I was unable to find anything fitting that description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How is this light grey one on the right on the bottom middle? <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a grey and brown one on the left on the bottom section, and a blue and white shirt as well as a light grey one just in front of it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry I don't have any black shirts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which coats? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black one is 109.99, and the light grey costs 179.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a blue and grey shirt on the lower right of the table, a blue and white shirt next to it, and a grey and brown shirt diagonal to that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both shirts are by Modern Arts. The light grey shirt has a 3.7 rating, but the grey and brown shirt has only a 2.8 rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm afraid the light grey shirt and the grey and brown shirt are the only ones currently available that fit your description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Other than this light grey shirt, there's the blue and grey shirt and the blue and white one from earlier. What are your thoughts on those three? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure! I have a grey sweater on the bottom left and another grey sweater next to the light grey shirt. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've got the blue jacket hanging in the top row, as well as the light gray one hanging in the bottom row. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That coat is the only one with that sleeve length. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The gray one has a 2.6, the blue one has a 2.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> For which jacket? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It has a 2.6. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can offer you the grey and black sweater on the tiered shelf on the left. It is on the bottom tier, in the back row on the left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I do not have jackets with these characteristics at the moment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Great choices! I am updating your cart to include them right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have several long-sleeve sweatshirts in medium on that tiered shelf.  How do you like the purple one on the middle tier, the maroon one in the back row on the bottom tier, and the grey one in the front row on that tier? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I would also consider the grey sweatshirt on the left on the bottom tier. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of this brown, white shirt on the floor rack, the the black one on the same rack? They both have half sleeves. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at this brown one on the back floor rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find anything like that unfortunately. Could I help with something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing that matches your criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I added it to the cart for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like this black t-shirt in the back? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This black one in the back and the brown and white one next to it are what I have available right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have any other t-shirts in extra large that have a good customer rating. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes. I will add that one now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like either of the two coats on that back rack? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like this blue one on the rack against the back wall? It is an expensive jacket from Home Store. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The one on the back rack is available in extra small and large. The one on the table in the front is available only in extra small. <end>
<cls> <sep2> This one on the back is what I have like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will add those items now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. Adding it now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the red and white jacket? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the blue jacket? It matches your search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but nothing matches your search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The blue jacket is blue and the other is red and white. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There are blue jeans on the left closet which match your search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the grey and white one hanging up on the wall on the left, the grey and white one hanging on the bottom rack on the right, or the blue one hanging in the center of the right wall? They are all jackets. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This one is by Downtown Consignment. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will add those two items right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The blue jacket in the front on the bottom rack, the blue jacket in the center on the rack, and the blue jacket on the back left wall are the similar items I have to show you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There's a blue-grey one on the back wall and a brown one on the right that you might like. <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's just that and the brown one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the light blue jeans? You might like the grey, as well. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The light blue are a M and are rated 4.9. The grey are a L and are rated 4.3. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey-blue and the brown both come in that size. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, what do you think of the red and white jacket on the wall straight back?  If those colors clash too much for you, you might like the blue jacket hanging up in the middle of the right wall, or the black one to your immediate right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, could you clarify which jackets you're referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black jacket costs $174.99 and has a customer rating of 4.0.  The blue one costs $39.99 and has a customer rating of 4.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure thing, I've added it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, how do you like the blue jacket in the top right corner of the far wall?  The blue and light grey jackets hanging up on the bottom rack to your near right also match that description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do!  At the back left you can see a green hoodie hanging on the wall.  There's also a blue one hanging near the back along the right wall, straight above the light grey pants. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately nothing I have matches those criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item would you like to know that for? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, the blue one only comes in S, but the green one comes in S, M and L. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That's it for hoodies right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one are you interested in? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The customer reviews are 4.2 and it is made by HairDo. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I couldn't find anything in size m. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, the only jeans available we have are these grey ones you are looking at. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I didn't find anything sorry. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The black one is 3.0 and the other is 3.8. <end>
<cls> <sep2> In the rack, there's a black coat and brown coat to the left, and a grey one to the front right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Okay, doing that now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure!  Over to the bottom right you can see a brown one on the circular rack.  At the back wall in the section to the left of the bright blue jacket you can see a couple more brown hoodies. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yea, there's actually one more brown hoodie on the round rack at the front right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything else like that right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, they're actually both XXL and rated at 4.0. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, the grey hat is now in your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I do, there's a black coat and two grey ones on the rack at the front right, all of which come in XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, up at the top left of the shelving unit is a grey coat, with a black one to the right of that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Well there's another brown hoodie to the left of the other one, and there's another brown hoodie right at the bottom right up front. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which brown hoodies? There are several. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, both of those are available in S, XL and XXL and have matching 4.0 ratings. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, how about the hats on the display here around the camo cap? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The two other blue jeans might interest you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Got it. Adding both of those hats now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which hat? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is $19.99 and comes in all sizes. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, on the counter in front of you there's a blue and green one at the far end, with a grey one just in front of it.  There's also a grey and white jacket on the right just underneath the red and white shoe boxes. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Of course you can, it'll be added to your cart right away. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which grey jacket do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's a size M. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey one on the counter is from that company. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this green hoodie? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The blue jacket is available in all sizes except for xs and it if from Global Voyager. The other one comes in s, xl and xxl and it is made by 212 Local. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything that would match your criteria. Is there anything else I could help you with today? <end>
<cls> <sep2> I will add it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here is one more I found for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the blue shirt and the blue and white shirt? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing else matches your search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you talking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It is available in sizes M, L, and XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, nothing matches your search criteria. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a yellow and brown one, or a dark yellow. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok, I added them to your shopping cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The dark yellow one is from Brain Puzzles, and the yellow/brown one is from Garden Retail.  Both have full sleeves. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have that one hanging in the back left. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't have anything like that, sorry. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the yellow, brown sweater in the back rack on the left or the dark yellow sweater on the back right rack? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The two yellow ones I recommended are the best suggestions I can make. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but it doesn't look like we have anything like that. Is there anything else I can get for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but there aren't any bicolored sweaters in XXL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> OK, I will add both to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I've got several for you to check out. There's a grey one on the left, the fourth one in on the bottom row. The fifth coat on that row is a brown one. I also have a black on the right center rack, about halfway in. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The only other option like that is the sixth coat on the left bottom row. It's also grey. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, I'm sorry, that's all. Can I help you in any other way? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Let's see what we have. I've got a yellow and brown sweater in the back center of the room. Right next to it is a dark yellow one. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Consider it done. I'm adding it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Let's try these. The second from last item on the top left row is a purple tshirt. I also have a white tshirt on the extreme right side. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, indeed. I'm adding it to your cart right now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Nothing came up for a half sleeve in size M with good customer reviews. <end>
<cls> <sep2> No, all I have is the white tee. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here's the difference. The first one is made by Downtown Stylists and the second is by Cats Are Great. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I could recommend this dark red one hanging on the right wall. It's a nice, plain shirt. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately, I don't see anything else that matches what you're looking for. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which dresses do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The violet one is a HairDo dress, and the purple one is from Modern Arts. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at this grey pair on the right wall and the brown pair next to them. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like the red shirt? <end>
<cls> <sep2> These dresses are the only options we have. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Both of these dresses come in XL <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The violet one is rated at 4.8 and comes in XL. The purple dress is rated at 3.6 and comes in XXL <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, what do you think of this violet dress on the very left? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> That dress is by HairDo. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Yes, in addition to that violet dress, I also have this purple one next to it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm afraid I don't have any dresses that cost $249.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the dark red shirt on the wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the grey trousers and the brown pair of trousers? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which items are you talking about? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The grey trousers are from The Vegan Baker and the brown trousers are from River Chateau. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, but no item matched your search criteria, <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like this grey one hanging on the bottom of the back wall? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This one is available in XL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will add it now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are these two black ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which coats are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The first one is available in XL and the brand is Pedals and Gears. The second one is available in XS, XXL, XL, M and L, and is from North Lodge. <end>
<cls> <sep2> The first one costs $109.99 with full sleeves and the other one costs $179.99 and has long sleeves. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry I can't find anything that matches. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about the green hoodie on the far wall, on the bottom row? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I couldn't find anything for you. Is there anything else I can do for you? <end>
<cls> <sep2> We have three pairs of blue jeans against the wall on the right. The far left pair is blue, the second pair from right is blue and black, and the pair on the right is light blue. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> All right, I'll do that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure, I'll add them both to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I can recommend the following expensive jeans. On the right side, I have blue jeans, blue and black jeans, and light blue jeans. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which ones are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> The brand for that item is Ocean Wears. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I couldn't locate anything matching those features. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'll do that now for you. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I have a grey and white jacket in the middle on the back wall, another grey and white next to it, and a light blue/light green jacket on the left. What do you think? <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the blue jeans in back on the right or the light blue in front on the right? <end>
<cls> <sep2> No problem, it's been added. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which pants do you mean? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are a size XS and go for 244.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Take a look at the blue hoodie hanging on the left and the other blue hoodie hanging at the bottom right rack. <end>
<cls> <sep2> There is a yellow tshirt displayed in the center back. <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both blue and priced at 129.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which item are you asking for specifics on? <end>
<cls> <sep2> They are both available in S. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How do you like the light grey coat in the middle of the top row on your right?  If you're looking for a more formal look, the two black coats under it would also be good options. <end>
<cls> <sep2> What do you think of the blue hoodie on the left?  The one on the right end of the bottom row on your left would also work, do you have any preference between those two? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything by Global Voyager matching your description. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't have anything matching that description.  Is there anything else I could help you find? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Certainly, I'll add it to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Check out the black one that sits first on the table to the right. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I am sorry, could you clarify which item you mean? <end>

<cls> <sep2> Does that grey one at the near end of the top row on the middle shelf speak to your fashion sense? It's made by the brand you specified! <end>
<cls> <sep2> In that case, check out the two grey options below it and the pleasant blue shirt next to the purple shirt. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Could you go for that white shirt at the very end of the bottom shelf, the white one a shelf up from that, or the white and blue shirt on the top shelf? <end>

<cls> <sep2> Not from River Chateau.  I don't think I have any with long sleeves and vertical stripes. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Just that jacket itself. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Here are a few long-sleeved shirts you might be interested in. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That is the only one of it's kind, I'm afraid. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sorry, I don't see any long-sleeves with vertical stripes. <end>

<cls> <sep2> The similar items are the light blue and green one on the front shelf, the grey one at the end of the top wall pole, and the light grey one under the blue jacket. <end>

<cls> <sep2> How about the brown hoodie on top in the middle? <end>

<cls> <sep2> The grey pair has a 4.3 while the dark blue pair has a higher rating at 4.7. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Sure. I'll add the blue ones to your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Not a problem. I've updated your cart. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about this dark green one? <end>
<cls> <sep2> This shirt is the only one that matches those preferences? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which coat are you referring to? <end>
<cls> <sep2> It's available in XL. <end>
<cls> <sep2> How about these two blue ones? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Do you like these grey ones in the right side cubby or the grey ones in the left side cubby? They are both pants. <end>
<cls> <sep2> These two pairs of pants are what I have like that. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will add those pants now. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Ok. I will add that second pair now, too. <end>
<cls> <sep2> For expensive sweaters, I have the Christmas one in the middle cabinet, and on the table I have the red one at the top left, and the red and white one next to it. <end>
<cls> <sep2> Which red one do you mean?  They all have some red. <end>
<cls> <sep2> That is 154.99. <end>
<cls> <sep2> I don't happen to have anything to show you.  Would you like to search for something else? <end>
<cls> <sep2> Unfortunately not.  May I assist you with anything else? <end>
